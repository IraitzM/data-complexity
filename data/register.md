# Registry

This folder holds some sample datasets to be used
for showcasing different complexity profiles.

## Linearly separable

A three axis set of data with linearly separable columns.

## Fuzzy

One axis is fixed byt the rest remain a little bit
scattered to complicate the work.

## Blobs

Created with the blob function separates the centroids for different classes.

## Random
